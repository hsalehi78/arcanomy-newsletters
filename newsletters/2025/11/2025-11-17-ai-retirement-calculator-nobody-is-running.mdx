Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

Your FIRE timeline assumes 20 years of stable income.

AI just cut it to 8.

Here's what nobody's talking about: Every retirement calculator on the planet asks how much you earn, what you can save, when you want to retire. The spreadsheets are beautiful. They model market crashes, sequence risk, safe withdrawal rates. They stress-test for inflation, healthcare costs, longevity.

Not one asks: What if your job disappears before you're ready?

We've spent a decade optimizing for portfolio volatility while completely ignoring the fact that the income funding those portfolios might vanish. Not because you chose to retire early... because your role literally ceased to exist.

The FIRE community has this backwards.

You know what's wild? We're stress-testing ships for storms while ignoring the iceberg directly ahead. The foundation isn't market returns anymore. It's earning capacity. And that foundation is melting faster than anyone wants to admit.

Plot twist: The math for this already exists. It's just hiding in plain sight, buried under assumptions nobody wants to challenge. Because modeling your own obsolescence feels different than modeling a bear market, doesn't it?

Here's the thing though.

Once you see the actual timeline, the whole FIRE calculation changes. Not slightly. Completely. Your safe withdrawal rate? Different. Your target number? Different. Your entire strategy for getting there? Yeah, that needs work too.

But it's not what you think.

The psychology underneath this is fascinating, honestly. We'd rather obsessively model market volatility than face the possibility that the role we're building our entire timeline around might not exist when we need it to. It's easier to stress-test a 4% withdrawal rate than to ask "will I still be employable in 2029?"

[The full breakdown](https://arcanomy.com/perspectives/ai-retirement-calculator-nobody-is-running) walks through the actual numbers and what this means for anyone planning to retire before 65.
