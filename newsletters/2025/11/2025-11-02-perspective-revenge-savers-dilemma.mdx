Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

$60,000 in savings. High-yield account paying 4.5%. Growing every month.

Sounds responsible, right?

It's rotting.

And it's costing you a decade of financial freedom.

Here's the thing... there's a new phenomenon economists are calling "revenge saving." It's the mirror image of the revenge spending that happened after COVID. Everyone went on a shopping spree post-lockdown. Now the pendulum's swung back hard in the opposite direction.

27% of investors in their twenties keep more than a quarter of their portfolio in cash. Not in stocks. Not in bonds. Cash. Meanwhile, 47% of Gen Z has literally zero emergency fund at all.

An entire generation split between cash hoarders and those with nothing.

But here's what's wild...

The people stuffing money into savings accounts think they're being smart. They watched their jobs disappear over Zoom. They saw inflation eat their grocery budget. They read recession headlines every morning for two years straight. Their nervous system learned a lesson: cash equals safety.

Your nervous system is wrong.

The psychology underneath this is fascinating (and kind of heartbreaking). It's not rational decision-making. It's trauma response dressed up as financial planning. And it's creating an illusion of security that actually delays the very thing it promises to protect.

The math on this is... honestly shocking. That $50k sitting in savings? It's quietly stealing 10 years of financial independence. Not because you're spending it. Because you're NOT putting it to work.

I kept $40,000 in cash for two years after 2020. I get it. The fear is real. The desire for control is real.

But there's a middle ground nobody's talking about. A place where money actually works instead of sitting in a parking lot pretending to be an investment portfolio.

**[I broke down the exact strategy in this week's article](https://arcanomy.com/perspectives/perspective-revenge-savers-dilemma)** - including the real numbers on what that "middle ground" actually looks like and how to find it without losing sleep over market crashes.

Because the difference between financial security and the illusion of financial security? That's everything.
