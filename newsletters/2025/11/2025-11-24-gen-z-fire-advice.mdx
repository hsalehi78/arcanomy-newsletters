<MainContentSection>

Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

Your 23-year-old just told you they're not saving for a house.

They're going to Portugal instead.

You think: irresponsible.

They think: rational.

Plot twist: They might be onto something you're missing.

That starter home you could've bought for $180k in 2012? It's $420k now. Same neighborhood. Same square footage. But salaries? They didn't double.

Gen Z ran the numbers and realized something quietly terrifying: The traditional playbook (save aggressively, sacrifice everything, buy house, build wealth) doesn't actually work anymore. Not mathematically. Not in this economy.

And before you say "they just need to work harder" or "stop buying avocado toast," consider this: What if rejecting broken financial advice is actually the smart move?

When the old rules stop working, the first people to notice aren't the ones who benefited from them. It's the ones getting crushed by them.

This isn't generational laziness. It's strategy.

The FIRE movement promised freedom through extreme saving. Rice and beans for 15 years, retire by 40. Clean math. Simple formula. And it worked... for people who started 10 years ago.

Then the math changed.

Home price-to-income ratios doubled. In cities like Miami and LA, we're talking 8-to-1 where 4-to-1 used to be normal. Even high earners feel squeezed.

So when your kid says they're spending money on experiences instead of saving for a down payment, they're not being reckless. They've accepted a reality you might not see yet.

Here's what nobody's talking about: When an entire generation opts out of traditional financial advice, it's not rebellion. It's recognition. Recognition that the game changed while everyone was still reading the old rulebook.

Sometimes the most responsible thing you can do is stop playing a rigged game.
