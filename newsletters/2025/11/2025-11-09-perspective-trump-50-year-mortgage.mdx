# Trump's 50-Year Mortgage Plan: Save $216/month, Lose $359,000 🏠

Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

Donald Trump just proposed a 50-year mortgage.

The pitch? Save $216 every month. Make homeownership "affordable" again. Lower payments, easier life, American Dream unlocked.

Sounds pretty good, right?

Here's what they're not telling you.

That $216 you're saving each month? It costs you $359,000 over your lifetime.

Not a typo. Three hundred and fifty-nine thousand dollars.

You're basically paying $1,660 for every dollar you "save" monthly. It's like using a credit card that charges 166,000% interest to buy groceries because hey, at least you didn't have to pay cash today.

And here's the thing... this isn't some fringe policy proposal. This is being pitched as a solution to the housing crisis. As something that helps people.

But who does it actually help?

Because when you stretch a mortgage from 30 years to 50 years, something really interesting happens to the math. Something that changes who wins and who loses. Something that makes a $400,000 loan turn into financial quicksand with better marketing.

The psychology underneath this is fascinating (and kinda terrifying). There's a reason why "lower monthly payment" feels like a win even when it's objectively a massive loss. There's a reason politicians love this kind of policy. And there's a reason banks are probably thrilled.

We broke down the actual numbers. Compared what you'd pay on a 30-year vs 40-year vs 50-year mortgage. Looked at who benefits and who gets crushed. Found the hidden trap that makes this feel like help when it's actually... something else entirely.

The full breakdown is wild.

Because if this becomes real policy, you need to know what you're actually signing up for.
