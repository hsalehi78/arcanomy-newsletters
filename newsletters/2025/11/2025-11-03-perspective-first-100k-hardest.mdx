Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

Charlie Munger once said something that stops people cold: "The first $100,000 is a bitch, but you gotta do it."

No fluff. No motivation. Just brutal honesty from a billionaire who watched fortunes made and lost for eight decades.

Here's what nobody tells you: 83% of millennials don't have a six-figure net worth. That's five out of six people your age still pushing the boulder uphill, wondering why nothing sticks.

But here's where it gets weird.

The first $100K takes 10 to 15 years of grinding. Your contributions do all the work. Your investments? Basically decoration. You're saving $500/month while everyone around you upgrades their life, and the math feels... pointless.

Then something shifts.

At $100K invested, a 7% return hands you $7,000 a year. Without you lifting a finger. That's months of contributions the market just generates. At $200K, it's $14,000. At $500K, it's $35,000 annually.

The boulder suddenly has momentum.

Warren Buffett made 99% of his net worth after age 50. Not because he got smarter. Because time and compounding finally had something to work with.

But here's the thing... your brain is actively sabotaging you from getting there. And it's not about discipline or willpower or any of that self-help BS.

There's a psychological reason why the first $100K feels violent. Why every 'no' drains you. Why people earning six figures still live paycheck to paycheck.

The psychology underneath this is fascinating (and kinda terrifying if you recognize yourself in it).

We broke down the exact mental traps keeping most people stuck, the mathematical inflection point where everything changes, and honestly... why Munger was right to call it what it is.

Because once you understand why it's hard, you stop fighting the wrong battle.
