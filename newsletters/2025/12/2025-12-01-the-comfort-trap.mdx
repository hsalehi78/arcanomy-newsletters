You ever notice how your baseline quietly shifts?

Last year the regular Uber was fine.

Now it feels… wrong.

Not because anything changed out there — but because something drifted inside.

I caught myself doing that.

The nicer coffee. The nicer ride. The "might as well" upgrade.

None of it feels expensive in the moment.

It feels like maintenance.

Like keeping up with a version of yourself you didn't consciously choose.

**That's the trap.**

Comfort isn't a luxury anymore, it's the default.

And once you get used to an upgrade, going back feels like loss — even when you didn't need the upgrade to begin with.

I'm not saying cut anything.

I'm saying _notice_ it.

Because most comfort spending isn't about comfort.

It's about exhaustion.

It's about wanting a tiny slice of ease in a week that keeps asking for more.

Awareness is the only upgrade that actually pays you back.

The rest?

Nice to have. But pricey if you stop paying attention.

I wrote more about this — the psychology behind it, why researchers call it "hedonic adaptation," and what actually helps.
