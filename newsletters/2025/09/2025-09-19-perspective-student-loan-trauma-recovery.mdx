# Why your therapist can't afford therapy either

Hey {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}},

So I just learned something that broke my brain a little.

Psychology majorsâ€”the people literally trained to help us process our feelingsâ€”graduate with $224,000 in debt. Starting salary? $45k.

That's like buying a Ferrari to deliver for Uber Eats. In a Prius zone.

**Quick vibe check:** 56% of student borrowers have anxiety. 32% have depression. And 1 in 14 have considered... the permanent unsubscribe button. Because of loans. Not existential dread or climate change or the finale of Lost. Loans.

Your brain now treats FedLoan.gov like other people treat spiders. Or clowns. Or spider clowns.

**Meanwhile, in plot twist news:**

Remember that SAVE plan that would lower your payments? Still frozen in court. Your $500 payment just became $1,100. It's like your gym membership suddenly including a mandatory personal trainer named Chad who only yells.

The new "Repayment Assistance Plan" (lol) extends forgiveness from 20 to 30 years. That's not assistance. That's adding another season to a show that should've ended five seasons ago.

**The fun part nobody mentions:**

After December 31, 2025, forgiven loans = taxable income. So after 20 years of payments, the IRS shows up like "Surprise! You owe $67,000!"

It's basically a financial jump scare scheduled for 2045.

**Today's 5-minute therapy session** (the only one you can afford):

1. Call your loan servicer. Get your forgiveness date. Yes, it'll hurt like ripping off a Band-Aid made of bees.
2. Calculate your future tax bomb (forgiven amount Ã— 0.3)
3. Open a savings account named "2045 Tax Surprise Party ðŸŽ‰"
4. Put in $50. Just $50. This isn't about math, it's about giving the finger to chaos.

Look, you're not bad with money. You bought into a system where Navient's stock goes up when your mental health goes down. Your suffering is literally someone's dividend payment. 

That's not a you problem. That's a "society needs therapy" problem.

Which, ironically, we can't afford.

Talk soon,
The Arcanomy Team

**P.S.** Your $1,100 monthly payment = 71 Chipotle bowls. Or one month of therapy. Or 1/6th of what Navient's CEO makes in a single day. Choose your own adventure of sadness!
