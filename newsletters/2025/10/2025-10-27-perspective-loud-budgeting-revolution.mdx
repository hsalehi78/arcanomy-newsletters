# Your budget just became a flex
</TitleSection>

<MainContentSection>
A 23-year-old opens her banking app on camera. $1,200 rent. $300 groceries. $150 utilities.

She posts it to TikTok.

2.6 million views.

Your parents whispered about money behind closed doors. Gen Z screen-records their budget apps for the entire internet. And somehow... it became the ultimate status symbol.

Welcome to loud budgeting, where saying "I can't afford that" is cooler than pretending you can.

Here's what's wild, {{subscriber.firstName || 'there'}}: For a century, showing off expensive stuff proved you made it. Gen Z flipped the entire script. Now 42% openly tell friends about their financial limits. Meanwhile, their parents' generation went into debt pretending they could afford brunch every weekend.

What changed? And why does a mundane budget breakdown get millions of views?

The psychology underneath this shift is fascinatingâ€”and it might be the smartest financial move a generation has made in decades. But it's not what you think.

Your budget isn't something to hide anymore. It's a statement about who you're becoming.
